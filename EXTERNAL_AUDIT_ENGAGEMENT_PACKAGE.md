## Critical Areas for External Review

### 1. Authorization System
**Location**: `distribute_winnings.rs`, `refund_wager.rs`
**Changes Made**:
- Added comprehensive authority validation
- Implemented double-checking of game server authority
- Enhanced account constraints

**Questions for Auditor**:
- Is the authorization system sufficiently robust?
- Are there any edge cases in authority validation?
- Should we implement multi-signature authority?

### 2. Arithmetic Safety
**Location**: `validation.rs` (safe_math module)
**Changes Made**:
- Implemented safe arithmetic operations
- Added overflow/underflow protection
- Created safe earnings calculation

**Questions for Auditor**:
- Are all arithmetic operations properly protected?
- Are there any edge cases in calculations?
- Should we add additional bounds checking?

### 3. Reentrancy Protection
**Location**: All instruction handlers
**Changes Made**:
- Added reentrancy guard to GameSession
- Implemented protection macros
- Applied to all critical functions

**Questions for Auditor**:
- Is the reentrancy protection sufficient?
- Are there any bypass scenarios?
- Should we add additional protection mechanisms?

### 4. Input Validation
**Location**: All instruction handlers
**Changes Made**:
- Created comprehensive validation framework
- Added session ID format validation
- Implemented team number validation
- Added bet amount bounds checking

**Questions for Auditor**:
- Is input validation comprehensive enough?
- Are there any missing validation checks?
- Should we add additional sanitization?

## Security Test Scenarios

### 1. Authorization Bypass Tests
```typescript
// Test unauthorized access attempts
it("Should fail when non-authority tries to distribute winnings", async () => {
  const maliciousServer = Keypair.generate();
  // Attempt to distribute winnings with wrong authority
  // Should fail with UnauthorizedDistribution error
});
```

### 2. Arithmetic Overflow Tests
```typescript
// Test large number handling
it("Should handle large numbers without overflow", async () => {
  const maxBet = new BN("18446744073709551615");
  // Should not panic or produce incorrect results
});
```

### 3. Reentrancy Attack Tests
```typescript
// Test reentrancy protection
it("Should prevent reentrancy attacks", async () => {
  // Attempt to call function recursively
  // Should fail with AlreadyProcessing error
});
```

### 4. Race Condition Tests
```typescript
// Test concurrent access
it("Should handle concurrent team joining", async () => {
  // Simulate multiple players joining simultaneously
  // Should not allow duplicate slot assignment
});
```

## Dependencies Security Status

### Critical Vulnerabilities (In Solana SDK)
1. **curve25519-dalek 3.2.1** → Requires Solana SDK update
2. **ed25519-dalek 1.0.1** → Requires Solana SDK update

### Unmaintained Packages
3. **atty 0.2.14** → Low priority
4. **derivative 2.2.0** → Low priority
5. **paste 1.0.15** → Low priority

### Unsound Packages
6. **borsh 0.9.3** → Requires Solana SDK update
